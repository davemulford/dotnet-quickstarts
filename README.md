# dotnet-quickstarts

Welcome to the Red Hat dotnet-quickstarts. We hope your stay is wonderful. :sparkles:

## Getting started

The quickstarts contained in this repository assume you are running on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 or greater, and that you've installed .NET Core 1.0 by following our [getting started guide](https://access.stage.redhat.com/documentation/en/net-core/1.0/getting-started-guide/).

These quickstarts were written using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), but you can use whichever editor you'd like. If you do decide to use vscode, it is recommended that you install the C# extension before proceeding.  To do so, inside vscode press `Ctrl+Shift+P` then type *install extensions* and hit `<ENTER>`. Search for *C#* and click the install button next to the extension.

## Following along

The quickstarts are named using sequential order. If you plan on going through all of the sample applications, you should start at [01-helloworld](./01-helloworld) and work your way up via the numbered samples.
